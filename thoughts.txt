- without changing the cwd, requires arent going to work in tileset configs.
    - fixing this would probably require threads?
        1. change cwd for whole program in parsing the tileset -> if the program switches dirs later,
           requires located inside, for instance, a func that hasn't run yet would probably break
        2. spawning a thread (for each tset??) -> communicating... probably more difficult?
           would need to check how send works at min, maybe sync
    - for now, just let it be single file
