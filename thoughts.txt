- without changing the cwd, requires arent going to work in tileset configs.
    - fixing this would probably require threads?
        1. change cwd for whole program in parsing the tileset -> if the program switches dirs later,
           requires located inside, for instance, a func that hasn't run yet would probably break
        2. spawning a thread (for each tset??) -> communicating... probably more difficult?
           would need to check how send works at min, maybe sync
    - for now, just let it be single file

- it would be useful to have some stuff be determined via lua, but stay determined afterwards. perhaps add some fields to Tileset which would only be set after like a Tileset.setup() call? Or perhaps a new type with those fields added? for instance setup() would determine the selected recipe, and then permanently add it to a field in the new/altered Tileset, so that the function call (and associated validation) would only be performed once
