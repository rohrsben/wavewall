- without changing the cwd, requires arent going to work in tileset configs.
    - fixing this would probably require threads?
        1. change cwd for whole program in parsing the tileset -> if the program switches dirs later,
           requires located inside, for instance, a func that hasn't run yet would probably break
        2. spawning a thread (for each tset??) -> communicating... probably more difficult?
           would need to check how send works at min, maybe sync
    - for now, just let it be single file
- store a reference to a pixel in the image, and then realize it with the colorizer function so that
  theres only one pass?



- allow probability for tile selections
- coloring
    - color code <-> color code
    - lua function
- pseudotiles
    - reflection
    - rotation
- connected components across tiles
- integer multiple tiles
